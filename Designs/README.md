# Pablo Engine's Icon
The project's icon is being maintained by [@pmkary](https://github.com/pmkary) so if you wished any changes please contact: [k@karyfoundation.org](mailto:k@karyfoundation.org).

The main icon file is the `icon.sketch`. If you don't have access to the [Sketch 3](https://www.sketchapp.com/) there are both PNG and SVG renders of this icon. For the SVG model you'll have to have the [Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville) font family installed on your machine

Have fun!
